1) add some randomness to the attack damage of the towers, also give it a chance for critical hits
2) Have all the enemies spawn at the same time
3) visually show a difference in tower upgrades
4) move all the game variables into a json file that the .html loads from (For example starting gold, enemy health, enemy speed, tower strength, ect.) so that I more easily balanace the game manually myself.
5) move the end game button further out somewhere else
6) Be able to purchase new types of buildings that I eventually place.
7) double clicking tower selection button (example Q) to have it be able to keep that tower selected
8) add a boost button 'b' that can be periodically pressed to shoot faster
9) Add system messages on the top of screen like "Life lost", or "Wave complete
10) Gain gold at the end of each wave.
11) Have the enemies drop items ocassionally that benefit the player (For example, extra gold, or increased damage ect.)
12) Have the enemies increase in speed and life each wave (Have these settings defined as )

1) when I refresh the webpage enemies start spawning before I'm ready for the first wave, I want to be able to place towers before the first wave starts,
2) move all the game variables into a json file that the .html loads from (For example starting gold, enemy health, enemy speed, tower strength, ect.) so that I more easily balanace the game manually myself.
3) when a tower is upgraded, it now visually is larger than the square its on so the towers can appear to be overlapping, make it so it cant be larger thant he square when upgrading
4) add a boost button 'b' that can be periodically pressed to shoot faster


5) move the end game button further out somewhere else so its less likely to be pushed, and make it red, and are you sure button
6) Be able to purchase new types of buildings that I can eventually place.
7) Gain gold at the end of each wave.



Ideas 5/2
Be able to purchase bombs to manually place
update the graphics for the towers
have melee vs range towers
have towers have elemental types, so there are weaknesses and strengths for specific enemies
be able to select eenmies to read about them
Rebalance the game, make bosses easier
Save scoreboard,integrate with flask
save state the game
build profiles, be able to have currency build up in between waves

IDeas 5/3


modify the tower_defense game to have the following types enemies
- Fire üî• ‚Äì Strong against Nature (burns plants), weak to Water (extinguished by it).
- Water üåä ‚Äì Strong against Fire (quenches flames), weak to Electric (conducts electricity).
- Nature üçÉ ‚Äì Strong against Earth (overgrows rocks), weak to Fire (burns easily).
- Earth üèîÔ∏è ‚Äì Strong against Electric (grounds electricity), weak to Water (erosion).
- Electric ‚ö° ‚Äì Strong against Water (conducts electricity), weak to Earth (grounded).
- Ice ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚Äì Strong against Nature (freezes plants), weak to Fire (melts easily).

Replace the exisiting enemies in the game-config.js file with these enemies (but keep Tank,flying and boss). Add some more configuration variables for these new enemies with % weakness to element type and % resistance to element tyoe (For example Fire enemy is 80% weak against water and %80 resistance to nature)
While you are doing this, create a fire,waterr,nature,earth,electric,ice tower in the tower shop to purcahse that can damage with these corresponding elements
please be careful not to change any features or parameters you dont have to avoid other unexpected changes to the game, only perform the exact changes needed to perform my above request,only modify code directly related to my above request,Do not remove any existing functions unless explicitly mentioned


Provide a list of upcoming waves and the types of enemies that will be in it
Add long term currency like diamonds for killing boses that can add other things you can buy outside of that one game
select enemies and see their stats
put emookies on towers
have frost tower slow down enemies
cheat sheet guide on the side of element types and summary of weakness/resistance of each type
have all the enemies come out over 5 seconds


Help me update my tower-defense.html game.

modify the frost tower to slow down enemies, and have the enemies have some sort of visual effect showing that they are slow and add that description in the tower stats. put the new configuration variables for the frost tower in  the game-config.json.

Ideas 5/4

-Reduce elements to Fire,Water,Earth to simplify, change frost to slow. By default keep a 'normal tower' anda melee tower. In the shop buy an anti-air tower 
-Have enemy specifc waves (All Water,Earth, ect.), then a mixed wave, then just an air wave
- Keep an information board to teh right showing the next 5 wave types to prepare the user
- Upload to Gitlab io for web hosting
